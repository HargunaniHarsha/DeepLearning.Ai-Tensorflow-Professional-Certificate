Q-Question, A-Answer, E-Explanation

Q1. What is the difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?
A1. In traditional programming, a programmer has to formulate or code rules manually, whereas, in Machine Learning, the algorithm automatically formulates the rules from the data.
E1. Exactly! Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data known as “training data” in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Q2. What do we call the process of telling the computer what the data represents (i.e. this data is for walking, this data is for running)?
A2. Labelling the Data
E2. Yes! Labeling typically takes a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of it with informative tags.

Q3. What is a Dense layer?
A3. A layer of connected neurons
E3. Correct! In Keras, dense is used to define a layer of connected neurons.

Q4. How do you measure how good the current ‘guess’ is?
A4. Using the Loss Function
E4. Absolutely!  An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function.

Q5. What does the optimizer do?
A5. Generates a new and improved guess
E5. Nailed it! The optimizer figures out the next guess based on the loss function.

Q6. What is Convergence?
A6. The process of getting very close to the correct answer
E6. That’s right! Convergence is when guesses get better and better closing to a 100% accuracy.

Q7. What does model.fit do?
A7. It trains the neural network to fit one set of values to another
E7. Correct! The training takes place on the fit command.
