Q-Question, A-Answer, E-Explanation

Q1. How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
A1. They isolate features in images
E1. Additionally, a properly designed convolution layer can even make training faster.

Q2. What does the Pooling technique do to the images?
A2. Reduces information in them while maintaining some features
E2. Pooling reduces information without removing all of the features.

Q3. True or  False. If you pass a 28x28 image through a 3x3 filter the output will be 26x26.
A3. True

Q4. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, the output will be 56x56.
A4. False
E4. Yes! The output would actually be 13x13

Q5. How does using Convolutions in our Deep neural network impact training?
A5. Its impact will depend on other factors.
E5. Correct! Using convolutions might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
