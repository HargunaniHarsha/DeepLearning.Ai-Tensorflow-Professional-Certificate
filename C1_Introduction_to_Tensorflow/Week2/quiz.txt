A1. 28x28 Greyscale

Q2. Why are there 10 output neurons in the Neural Network used as an example for the Computer Vision Problem?
A2. There are 10 different labels

Q3. What does Relu do?
A3. It only returns x if x is greater than zero

A5. False
E5. Absolutely! The function activates at the end of every epoch

Q6. Why do you set the callbacks= parameter in your fit function?
A6. So, on every epoch you can call back to a code function
E6. Thatâ€™s right! You can have it check the metrics and stop the training.
