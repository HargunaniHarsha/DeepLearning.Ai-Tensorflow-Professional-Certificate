Q-Question, A-Answer, E-Explanation

Q1. Using Image Generator, how do you label images?
A1. It’s based on the directory the image is contained in.
E1. That’s right! The directory of the image is the label.

Q2. What method on the Image Generator is used to normalize the image?
A2. rescale
E2. This is the correct method for normalizing images.

Q3. How did we specify the training size for the images?
A3. The target_size parameter on the training generator.

Q4. When we specify the input_shape to be (300, 300, 3), what does that mean?
A4. Every Image will be 300x300 pixels, with 3 bytes to define color

Q5. If your training data is close to 1.000 accuracy, but your validation data isn’t, what’s the risk here?
A5. You’re overfitting on your training data.
E5. The analysis corresponds too closely to the training data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data.

Q6. Convolutional Neural Networks are better for classifying images like horses and humans because:
A6. 1)There’s a wide variety of horses.
    2)There’s a wide variety of humans.
    3)In these images, the features may be in different parts of the framE.
E6. CNNs are better in this case as they are independent from prior knowledge and human intervention in feature extraction.
    The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.
    
Q7. After reducing the size of the images, the training results were different. Why?
A7. We removed some convolutions to handle the smaller images
E7. Yes! Removing some convolutions modifies the training results.
