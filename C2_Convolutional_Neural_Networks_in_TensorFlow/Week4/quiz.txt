Q-Question, A-Answer, E-Explanation

Q1. The diagram for traditional programming had Rules and Data In, but what came out?
A1. Answers
E1. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Q2. Why does the DNN for Fashion MNIST have 10 output neurons?
A2. The dataset has 10 classes
E2. There are 10 output neurons because we have 10 classes of clothing in the dataset. These should always match.

Q3. What is a Convolution? 
A3. A technique to extract features from an image

Q4. Applying Convolutions on top of a DNN will have what impact on training?
A4. It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN

Q5. What method on an ImageGenerator is used to normalize the image? 
A5. rescale

Q6. When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.
A6. Nothing

Q7. Can you use Image augmentation with Transfer Learning? 
A7. Yes. It's pre-trained layers that are frozen. So you can augment your images as you train the bottom layers of the DNN with them

Q8. When training for multiple classes what is the Class Mode for Image Augmentation?
A8. class_mode='categorical'
