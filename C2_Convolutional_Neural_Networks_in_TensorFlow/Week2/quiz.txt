Q-Question, A-Answer

Q1. How do you use Image Augmentation in TensorFLow
A1. Using parameters to the ImageDataGenerator

Q2. If my training data only has people facing left, but I want to classify people facing right, how would I avoid overfitting?
A2. Use the ‘horizontal_flip’ parameter

Q3. When training with augmentation, you noticed that the training is a little slower. Why?
A3. Because the image processing takes cycles

Q4. What does the fill_mode parameter do?
A4. It attempts to recreate lost information after a transformation like a shear

Q5. When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.
A5. Nothing, all augmentation is done in-memory

Q6. How does Image Augmentation help solve overfitting?
A6. It manipulates the training set to generate more scenarios for features in the images

Q7. When using Image Augmentation my training gets...
A7. Slower

Q8. Using Image Augmentation effectively simulates having a larger data set for training.
A8. True
