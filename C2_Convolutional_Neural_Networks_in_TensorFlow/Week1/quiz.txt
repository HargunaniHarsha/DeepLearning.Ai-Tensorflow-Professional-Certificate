Q-Question, A-Answer, E-Explanation

Q1. What does flow_from_directory give you on the ImageDataGenerator?
A1. All of the above
E1. The flow_from_directory method takes the path to a directory & generates batches of augmented data.
    - The ability to easily load images for training
    - The ability to pick the size of training images
    - The ability to automatically label images based on their directory name
  
Q2. If my Image is sized 150x150, and I pass a 3x3 Convolution over it, what size is the resulting image?
A2. 148x148

Q3. If my data is sized 150x150, and I use Pooling of size 2x2, what size will the resulting image be?
A3. 75x75

Q4. If I want to view the history of my training, how can I access it?
A4. Create a variable ‘history’ and assign it to the return of model.fit or model.fit_generator
E4. The History.history attribute is a record of training loss values and metrics values at successive epochs.

Q5. What’s the name of the API that allows you to inspect the impact of convolutions on the images?
A5. The model.layers API

Q6. When exploring the graphs, the loss levelled out at about .75 after 2 epochs, but the accuracy climbed close to 1.0 after 15 epochs. What's the significance of this?
A6. There was no point training after 2 epochs, as we overfit to the training data.

Q7. Why is the validation accuracy a better indicator of model performance than training accuracy?
A7. The validation accuracy is based on images that the model hasn't been trained with, and thus a better indicator of how the model will perform with new images.

Q8. Why is overfitting more likely to occur on smaller datasets?
A8. Because there's less likelihood of all possible features being encountered in the training process.
