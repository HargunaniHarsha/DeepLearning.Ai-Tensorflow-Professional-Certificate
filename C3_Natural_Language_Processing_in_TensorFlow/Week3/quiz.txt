Q1. Why does sequence make a large difference when determining semantics of language?
A1. Because the order in which words appear dictate their impact on the meaning of the sentence

Q2. How do Recurrent Neural Networks help you understand the impact of sequence on meaning?
A2. They carry meaning from one cell to the next

Q3. How does an LSTM help understand meaning when words that qualify each other aren’t necessarily beside each other in a sentence?
A3. Values from earlier words can be carried to later ones via a cell state

Q4. What keras layer type allows LSTMs to look forward and backward in a sentence?
A4. Bidirectional

Q5. What’s the output shape of a bidirectional LSTM layer with 64 units?
A5. (None, 128)

Q6. When stacking LSTMs, how do you instruct an LSTM to feed the next one in the sequence?
A6. Ensure that return_sequences is set to True only on units that feed to another LSTM

Q7. If a sentence has 120 tokens in it, and a Conv1D with 128 filters with a Kernal size of 5 is passed over it, what’s the output shape?
A7. (None, 116, 128)

Q8. What’s the best way to avoid overfitting in NLP datasets?
A8. None of the above
